# How to play
    
You can play the character with your keyboard.

The arrow keys _'Left', 'Right', 'Up' and 'Down'_ move the player accordingly.  
The **enemies** spawn with different speed from the left and move to the right. After they vanish, they respawn on the left side.

## The goal

The goal of the game is to reach the water. Is that goal reached, the player is reset to the starting position.  
Should the player hit one of the **enemies**, he will also be reset to the beginning
